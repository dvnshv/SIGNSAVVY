# SIGNSAVVY
Sign Language Learning Platform: This is an interactive website intended to teach sign language through engaging video-based quizzes. Users view a video demonstrating a hand sign and select the correct option from four choices, which makes learning intuitive and enjoyable. Being part of the frontend development team in a group of five, I contributed to building a responsive and visually appealing interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I optimized video integration; implemented dynamic quiz functionality with shuffled options; ensured access using semantic HTML and ARIA roles. The focus of my efforts has been on making for delivering a seamless, inclusive user experience both in terms of usability and performance.
